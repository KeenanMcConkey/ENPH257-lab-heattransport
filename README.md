# ENPH 257 Lab - Heat Transport
#### Group Members: Keenan McConkey, Glyn Finck, Austin Khorram, Daniel Kor

This project involves thermal simulation and measurement for thermodynamics class ENPH 257. Heat transport through an aluminum beam was simulated in MATLAB and then compared to data taken from a real life rod. An arduino sensor system was built to retrieve thermal data at different points along the rod. This sensor system fed this data into MATLAB via the library Processing.
